# Project Title : Template Engine - Employee Summary

 This is a software engineering team generator command line application. Use Node CLI to capture user input about employees and generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing during development will be handled with Jest to reduce development time and ensure reliability.

## Installation
install node.js, run npm init, run npm i.

I copied the project from the homework template folder. There is a package.json included so I use npm install to install the dependencies.


## Project Overview
   Use node.js to build a software engineering team generator command line application. The app will need to have conditional checks to gather the appropriate information for each employee. 

In order to accomplish the project requirements I wanted to simplify the development by re-using code for the employee objects. Each employee type will also have a HTML template so I can keep the development seperated. 
The command line engine will leverage inquirer to generate the question prompts. based on what employee type is selected, the following prompts will be generated. This is challenging from a coding perspective since there are several ways to accomplish the task. 

The app will need to determine when the entire team has been entered so it can generate the final HTML webpage. This step will combine the input data, with the HTML templates to dynamically create the final result. 

Since the project is not hosted, I will include screenshots, and GIF style images to demonstrate the result.
